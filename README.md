# The computer, reinvented for accelerated AI computing!

## Overview and Origin
NVIDIA, is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and was founded in 1993. They invented the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) in 1999.  And became the fuel that led the growth of the PC gaming market, and helped ignite the era of modern artificial intelligence 
NVIDIA empowers process improvement across multiple AI industries. From generative AI and speech recognition to medical imaging and supply chain management, their technology provides companies with the tools and algorithms needed for accelerated computer processing. (1)
Most notably, their GE Force Graphic Cards offers advanced gaming solutions.  
* Name of company

Nvidia.com

* When was the company incorporated?

April 5, 1993

* Who are the founders of the company?

Jensen Huang, Curtis Priem, Chris Malachowsky

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The three co-founders envisioned that gaming computing would play a big role in the acceleration of computer processing. They believed that graphics-based processing had a unique ability to tackle computer industry challenges that could not be solved by not gaming related computing. Video games became their primary focus to reach large consumer markets and to overall solve general computational problems. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Starting with $40,000 dollars in the bank they launched the company.  Then they received $20 million in venture capital funds from Sequoia Capital and other financial sources. Today they now have over $32B in operating income, and total assets in excess of $65B

## Business Activities
They created the first graphics accelerator product called NV 1.  (NV = Next Version)
Went public on January 22, 1999 and later that year launched their GeForce 256(NV10).  This improved transformation and lighting for consumer level 3D computing. In 2001 they were selected to the S&P 500 index fund.  July 2002 they acquired Excluna which gave them software rendering capabilities. Over the next 12 years they continued to grow and continued to acquire more companies like Portal Player Inc. Ageia, and PhysX.
In 2023 5h3y exceeded historical revenue of $1 Trillion dollars.  Growing to a market capitalization of $2 Trillion in 2024.  They continue to be a large player in GPU technologies and provide products to companies such as Tesla, Intel, and AMD. 
* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Initially they set out to solve the problem of needing faster computing for the gaming industry.  At that time video game functionality was incredibly challenging, and at the same time they saw that it had enormous commercial potential if a way could be found to create a processor fast enough to run graphics.  And with that new processor they new it would also resolve numerous other non-gaming computer processer speed issues that many industries were facing. 
They went on to be one of the largest players in the computer industry.  They have solved computation problems ranging from Cloud Services technology to even creating a open source ventilator during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Initially they focused specifically on the gaming industry graphic computing.  However, since they started they have now grown over the last 30 year period to processors and other products to a vast range of computer processing market needs. In fact, they are now the third company in history to have over $2 Trillion in market capitalization. They count Elon Musk of Tesla, Larry Ellison of Oracle, and other industry players as companies that are heavily dependent on their products and services.  
Their GPUs are now being used in cutting edge deep learning AI and accelerated analytics which are used in machine learning customers like Google Brain, Microsoft, and IBM.  As of 2024 they control approximately 68% of the total GPU market.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Their biggest advantage is that they were the creators of the first actual GPU which gives them significantly more industry knowledge than competitors.  Their products also solve non gaming industry computing problems where as some of their competitors focus only on gaming computer technology.  However, the sheer size of their company makes them on of the very few players in the computer acceleration market that can meet the needs of global companies like Tesla and Google. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
The NVIDIA CuTENSOR helps is a powerful GPU accelerated linear library.  This boosts performance in Deep Learning training, Computer Vision, Quantum chemistry, and Computational Physic applications.
Their Blackwell computing software is used in generative AI performance and efficiency.  And NVIDIA Turing architecture technology blends real time ray tracing with AI and simulation. 

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Primarily GPU production but also CPUs and other graphic editing and 3D rendering software. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
The biggest trend has been in AI adoption across industries. NVIDIA now not only creates products but they also partner with a large ecosystem of other computer industry companies by leveraging their technology, platforms, and software offerings. 

* What are the other major companies in this field?
Other players in their field include Broadcom, AMD, and Qualcomm. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
NVIDIA has been primarily responsible for the growth in the PC gaming industry.  Their GPU has accelerated the landscape of what is possible for online gaming. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
The two biggest metrics are, 1) Market Share and 2) Revenue.  They are the industry leader in both categories. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
They have about a 12 to 1 size advantage over their closest competitor.  

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
At this point, they are so large, the only recommendation I would have is for them to maintain a strong public and political relationship.  Having those strong relationships would help them if they ever had an unfortunate event like Budweiser had last year which cost them about 25% of market share. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Because from a product and technology offering perspective they are so far ahead of their competitors that really the only significant concern they have is if there is a catastrophic public relations or fundamental shift in the geo political landscape. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
  It would protect future development technologies. And act as a preventative service to future large scale events which potentially could harm the company significantly.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
  Not so much as technologies, but more policies, prevention, and practice that would be a good solution to have prepared in advance.  If Anheuser-Bush InBev would have been prepared with a catastrophic public relations plan they could have shortened the Bud Light boycott of 2023.
